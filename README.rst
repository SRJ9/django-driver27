driver27
========

Racing competition manager in Django where you can manage different
motor competitions with its own punctuation rules, races, drivers, teams
which, at the same time, can be part of multiple competitions.

Modify your settings.py
=======================

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'bootstrap3',
    ...
        'django_countries',
        'tabbed_admin',
        'rest_framework', # since v0.19.3
        'driver27'
    ]


    TABBED_ADMIN_USE_JQUERY_UI = True

DR27_CONFIG
===========
Now, you can add more punctuation and record configs adding DR27_CONFIG in your settings.py.
Follow this example
::

    DR27_CONFIG = {
        'RECORDS': {
            'PODIUM-GATES': {'label': _('At the gates of podium'), 'filter': {'finish__exact': 4}},
            ...
        },
        'PUNCTUATION': {
            'DR27-POINTS': {'type': 'full', 'finish': [10, 5, 3, 1], 'fastest_lap': 0, 'label': 'DR27 points'},
            ...
        }
    }

If you want to allow translate, add this import
::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

   champion be the same? This version will give you the answer.

   with superior race results (based on descending order, from number of
   wins to numbers of second-places down) will gain precedence.

   would be the champion predicting the results in the last races.
   Olympic rank is counted in case of points tie. Rosberg or Hamilton?

History
=======

Driver 27 is a reference to car number of Gilles Villeneuve, F1 Driver
died in 1982. Gilles is considered one of best driver despite he never
won the World Championship, something that Jacques Villeneuve, his son,
did in 1998.

In 1980's decade, F1 teams kept their numbers unless they were
champions. This made Ferrari, the most legendary team of the F1, take
that number for many years (1981-1995), making the number an icon of
this sport.
